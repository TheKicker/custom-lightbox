# Lightbox.js

Just a really simple plug-n-play lightbox I have made from the ground up.  Initially used on <a href="https://usadinnerwaredirect.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Dinnerware Direct</a> but will be used on other sites. Use your site or theme CSS to customize the lightbox, this is just the starter skeleton.
