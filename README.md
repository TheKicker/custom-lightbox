# Lightbox.js

Just a really simple lightbox I have made from the ground up.  Initially used on <a href="https://usadinnerwaredirect.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Dinnerware Direct</a> but will be used on other sites. 

<img src="assets/lightbox.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: 3rem auto;">

## Initial Features
<ul>
<li> 3.5 second (3500ms) delay before it appears </li>
<li> Shows/hides lightbox depending on if the user has visited already within the last 24 hours  </li>
<li> Custom message in console </li>
